  dc:description """
    The Study Cohort Ontology encodes the vocabulary to represent population desriptions in research studies, and provides the ability to model the aggregative descriptive statistical measures defined on the variables of subjects who are participants in the study population. We make it possible to represent a study component considered for determining the patient alignment to a research study, and we assist physicians in evaluating the fit of their patient population to the study population. In SCO, we are building a world-view inspired by the upper level Ontology SemanticScience Integrated Ontology (SIO) to model the descriptive statistics of characteristics on a set of patients (patient group) administered a medical intervention, and studied for an outcome in a research study.  Since we capture the various definitions of patient groups (ie. by interventional measures or by control mechanisms), we provide the basic framework for filtering searches and to define cohort similarity at different granularities. ( cohort level and the study group levels ). For researchers who wish to contribute to the expansion of our ontology, we advise that they refer to our ontology documentation to familiarize themselves with the structure and term annotations ( such as definitions and labels).
    """ ;
  dc:abstract """
    The Study Cohort Ontology (SCO) is developed to model overall structure and patterns of cohort variables and control/intervention groups defined within the structured population descriptions (commonly referred to as Table1's or Cohort Summary Tables)of observational case studies and clinical trials. We maintain only domain agnostic and commonly occuring subject variables and interventions in SCO, and we have a suite of ontologies (Diseases, Medications, LabResults etc) to encode Diabetes related terminology. We have adopted a bottom-up approach to modeling and we have revised the structure of SCO upon investigation of a few research studies (11 to be precise) from the Pharmacological Interventions (Chapter 8) and Cardiovascular Complications (Chapter 9) of the American Diabetes Association (ADA)’s Standards of Medical Care 2018 CPG. We enable deep drive visualizations driven off queries to knowledge graphs modeled on SCO, to help assist physician visualize the similarity of a patient to a study group, at a quick glance. We welcome contributions and suggestions to extend SCO to represent cohort descriptions of publications targeted to other diseases, and we plan to release set of tools to make this process seamless."""^^xsd:string ;

A biological father is the male genetic contributor to the creation of the baby, through sexual intercourse or sperm donation. A biological father may have legal obligations to a child not raised by him, such as an obligation of monetary support. A putative father is a man whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established. A stepfather is a male who is the husband of a child's mother and they may form a family unit, but who generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child." .

In many pre-modern societies fosterage was a form of patronage, whereby influential families cemented political relationships by bringing up each other's children, similar to arranged marriages, also based on dynastic or alliance calculations." .

Thus, dependent on the context, women can be considered mothers by virtue of having given birth, by raising their child(ren), supplying their ovum for fertilisation, or some combination thereof. Such conditions provide a way of delineating the concept of motherhood, or the state of being a mother. Women who meet the third and first categories usually fall under the terms 'birth mother' or 'biological mother', regardless of whether the individual in question goes on to parent their child. Accordingly, a woman who meets only the second condition may be considered an adoptive mother, and those who meet only the third a surrogacy mother. The above concepts defining the role of mother are neither exhaustive nor universal, as any definition of 'mother' may differ based on how social, cultural, and religious roles are defined." .

In some cultures, kinship relationships may be considered to extend out to people an individual has economic or political relationships with, or other forms of social connections. Within a culture, some descent groups may be considered to lead back to gods or animal ancestors (totems). This may be conceived of on a more or less literal basis." .

## Elucidation

This is used when the statement/axiom is assumed to hold true 'eternally'

## How to interpret (informal)

First the "atemporal" FOL is derived from the OWL using the standard
interpretation. This axiom is temporalized by embedding the axiom
within a for-all-times quantified sentence. The t argument is added to
all instantiation predicates and predicates that use this relation.

## Example

    Class: nucleus
    SubClassOf: part_of some cell

    forall t :
      forall n :
        instance_of(n,Nucleus,t)
         implies
        exists c :
          instance_of(c,Cell,t)
          part_of(n,c,t)

## Notes

This interpretation is *not* the same as an at-all-times relation
